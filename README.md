# Data Table with Power BI Integration

Welcome to the **Data Table with Power BI Integration** web application! This app allows you to interact with dummy data in a beautifully organized table format. With powerful filtering options and seamless integration with **Power BI**, you can easily visualize your data and gain insights in no time!

## Features

- **Interactive Data Table**: Display dummy data in a clean and organized table.
- **Column Filtering**: Customize the table by filtering which columns to display, giving you full control over the data.
- **Power BI Integration**: View dynamic reports on your data directly below the table with a fully integrated Power BI report.
- **React-based**: Built using React for fast, responsive, and smooth user experience.

## How It Works

1. **Filter Columns**: You can easily filter which columns to show or hide in the table by using the filter options.
2. **View Data**: Once you've set your filters, the table will update in real time to reflect your choices.
3. **Power BI Reports**: Below the table, you will find an embedded Power BI report that dynamically pulls data from the same source, helping you visualize the information more effectively.
